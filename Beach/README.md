Beach Scene for a Short Film Project for Revels 2019 using Blender, Cinema 4D, and OpenGL
Introduction
This project is contains a beach scene for a short film white noise using Blender, Cinema 4D, and OpenGL. The scene features a beach with sand, water, and palm trees, as well as a sun and sky. The scene will be rendered using OpenGL and can be used in a variety of short film projects.The beach is a mirror of Kaup Bay situated in Udupi,Karnataka
