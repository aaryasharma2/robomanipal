Future Amusement Park in Space - Short Film Project for NASA CineSpace
Introduction
This project is a demonstration of how to create a futuristic amusement park in space using OpenGL and Blender. The project will be created for the NASA CineSpace short film competition. The park will feature a variety of rides and attractions, including roller coasters, spinning rides, and more.

Requirements
Blender 2.90 or higher
OpenGL 3.3 or higher
A graphics card with support for OpenGL 3.3 or higher
Knowledge of Blender and OpenGL
Blender Setup
Open Blender and create a new project.
In the Properties window, go to the World tab and set the background color to black to represent the void of space.
In the Scene tab, add a light to the scene to represent the sun.
Create the rides and attractions using Blender's modeling tools. For each ride, make sure to add materials and textures to give them a futuristic look.
Add people and other objects to the park to give it life and make it feel inhabited.
Render the scene using Blender's built-in rendering engine or an external renderer.
OpenGL Setup
Create an OpenGL project in Visual Studio or your preferred development environment.
Import the scene from Blender into the project.
Set up the camera position and viewing angle to showcase the amusement park in space.
Implement the lighting for the sun and other objects using OpenGL lighting functions.
Render the scene using OpenGL.
